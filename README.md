#Exploring the evolutionary signature of food webs’ backbones using functional traits

##Abstract
Increasing evidence suggests that an appropriate model for food webs, the
network of feeding links in a community of species, should take into account
the inherent variability of ecological interactions. Harnessing this
variability, we will show that it is useful to interpret empirically observed
food webs as realisations of a family of stochastic processes, namely random
dot-product graph models. These models provide an ideal extension of food-web
models beyond the limitations of current deterministic or partially
probabilistic models. As an additional beneﬁt, our RDPG framework enables us to
identify the pairwise distance structure given by species’ functional food-web
traits: this allows for the natural emergence of ecologically meaningful
species groups. Lastly, our results suggest the notion that the evolutionary
signature in food webs is already detectable in their stochastic backbones,
while the contribution of their ﬁne wiring is arguable.

##Content of Repository
All the R code used for the paper is in "Code" and the raw data in "Data".
I am currently working to transform the code in something more nice and pretty,
but for the moment is offered as it is. If you have any question about how to
us it, please do not hesitate to ask!
